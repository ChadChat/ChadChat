============================
			UDP
============================

Peer:
	-> Sets up a socket and connects to the server (may need DNS)
	-> Sends the "observed" ip and port information along the RSA pub/shit to
		the server. Try to keep the connection open.


Server:
	-> Sets up a socket and binds it to all interfaces and waits for incoming connections.
	-> When there is some new data read it with PROTO[1] and save the address and data of
		the new client, keep the connection open!!, and try to do some RSA pub/priv shit here
